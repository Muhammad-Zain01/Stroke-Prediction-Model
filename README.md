## Stroke Prediction Model
This Dataset is taken from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
### Context
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

This Prediction Model is based on Logistic Regression
